The linear regression was performed using the concepts from Bishops. The question already gave us two parameters that were influencing the last column. Now we had to find another column that had a prominent effect on the last column. Hence, I used an algorithm to index over the 2nd to 8th columns to find which one best fits the prediction. I used normal equation by using the inverse equation given in Bishops to find the parameter theta. This theta is the weight that can be used to predict the values considering the equation y = mX + C. Now, the ‘P’ values can be used to denote the least square errors pertaining to the data.
From the matrix generated, the third value, from 2nd to 8th row possesses the least value of the least square error and hence that pertains to the fourth row of the data set which is LIC. Therefore, LIC is the third row that helps in the prediction of values for HOM. 
The plot therefore, makes it easy to represent the data in a form that helps to denote the least square regression values pertaining to the column. This therefore shows that LIC has the least error and hence that is the answer.
